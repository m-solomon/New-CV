\cvevent{Research Assistant}{King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals}
{Feb. 2017 -- May. 2017}{Dhahran, KSA}
Assisted in a paper studying the performance of a patch-based image denoising algorithm using collaborative support-agnostic recovery.

%I am currently working on a digital image processing research paper that studies the performance of a new image denoising algorithm (Image Denoising via Collaborative Support-Agnostic Recovery) on high resolution images. This algorithm shows promising results, however, its performance is  compromised when used on high resolution images due to its heavy computational burden. My research aims to find different ways to reduce this computational burden
